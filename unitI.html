    The Structures of DNA and RNA/Genetic Material</h2>
    <div class="content">
    <p>Nucleic acids, DNA (deoxyribonucleic acid) and RNA (ribonucleic acid), are crucial biomolecules responsible for carrying and transmitting genetic information in living organisms.</p>
    
    <h4>DNA (Deoxyribonucleic Acid):</h4>
    <img src="dna.jpeg" alt="dna" style="height: 350px;">
    <ol type="i">
      <li><b class="bold">Structure:</b>DNA is composed of two long strands forming a double helix. Each strand consists of nucleotides, which have three components: a sugar molecule (deoxyribose), a phosphate group, and one of four nitrogenous bases (adenine, thymine, cytosine, or guanine).</li><br>
      <li><b class="bold">Base pairing:</b> Adenine pairs with thymine (A-T), and cytosine pairs with guanine (C-G). This complementary base pairing ensures the faithful transmission of genetic information during processes like replication.</li><br>
      <li><b class="bold">Function:</b>DNA serves as the primary storage of genetic information. Genes, segments of DNA, encode instructions for the synthesis of proteins and play a fundamental role in determining an organism's traits.</li>
      
     </ol>
     
     <h4>RNA (Ribonucleic Acid):</h4>
     <img src="mrna.png" alt="rna">
     <ol type="i">
       <li><b class="bold">Structure:</b>RNA is typically a single-stranded molecule, and its structure also includes nucleotides with a ribose sugar, a phosphate group, and one of four nitrogenous bases (adenine, uracil, cytosine, or guanine).</li><br>
       <li><b class="bold">Types of RNA:</b>There are three main types of RNA:
        <ul type="circle">
          <li><b class="bold">mRNA (Messenger RNA):</b>Carries genetic information from DNA to the ribosome for protein synthesis.</li><br>
          <li><b class="bold">tRNA (Transfer RNA):</b>Transfers amino acids to the ribosome during protein synthesis.</li><br>
          <li><b class="bold">rRNA (Ribosomal RNA):</b>Combines with proteins to form ribosomes, the cellular structures where proteins are synthesized.</li>
        </ul></li><br>
        <li><b class="bold">Function:</b>RNA plays a central role in translating genetic information from DNA into proteins. It acts as an intermediary in the synthesis of proteins by conveying the genetic code from DNA to the cellular machinery responsible for protein production.</li>
     </ol>
     <p>In summary, DNA stores genetic information in its double-stranded helical structure, while RNA translates and carries this information to facilitate protein synthesis. The specificity of base pairing ensures the accurate transmission of genetic instructions, contributing to the diversity and functioning of living organisms.</p>

    <h3 class="collapsible">DNA as the carrier of genetic information (Griffith’s, Hershey & Chase, Avery, McLeod & McCarty, Fraenkel-Conrat’s experiment.</h3>
    <div class="content">
      <p>DNA as the carrier of genetic information is a fundamental concept in molecular biology. It was established by a series of experiments in the 20th century that demonstrated that DNA, not proteins, is the molecule that stores and transmits genetic information from one generation to the next. Here is a brief summary of the main experiments that contributed to this discovery:</p>
      
      <ul type="circle">
        <li><b class="bold">Griffith's experiment (1928): </b>Frederick Griffith showed that a non-virulent strain of bacteria could be transformed into a virulent strain by a "transforming principle" from a heat-killed virulent strain. He suggested that this principle was a chemical substance that could change the hereditary characteristics of the bacteria.</li><br>
        
        <li><b class="bold">Avery, MacLeod and McCarty experiment (1944): </b>Oswald Avery, Colin MacLeod and Maclyn McCarty identified the transforming principle as DNA by using biochemical methods to isolate and purify different components of the bacterial cells. They showed that only DNA, not proteins or other molecules, could transform the non-virulent bacteria into virulent ones.</li><br>
        
        <li><b class="bold">Hershey and Chase experiment (1952):</b>Alfred Hershey and Martha Chase used bacteriophages, viruses that infect bacteria, to confirm that DNA is the genetic material. They labeled the DNA and the protein of the bacteriophages with different radioactive isotopes and tracked which molecule entered the bacterial cells during infection. They found that only the DNA, not the protein, was transferred into the bacteria, and that the DNA directed the synthesis of new bacteriophages.</li><br>
        
        <li><b class="bold">Fraenkel-Conrat experiment (1956): </b>Heinz Fraenkel-Conrat and Robley Williams showed that RNA, not protein, is the genetic material of some viruses. They used tobacco mosaic virus (TMV), a virus that infects plants, and mixed the RNA and the protein of two different strains of TMV. They found that the RNA determined the characteristics of the progeny viruses, not the protein.</li>
        
      </ul>
      
      <p>These experiments provided convincing evidence that DNA and RNA are the molecules of life that carry the genetic information for all living organisms. </p>

     <p>DNA, or deoxyribonucleic acid, is a complex molecule that carries genetic information. Its structure consists of two long strands forming a double helix. <br> key components of DNA are:-</p>
     <ol type="1">
       <li><b class="bold">Nucleotides:</b> These are the building blocks of DNA. Each nucleotide consists of a phosphate group, a sugar molecule (deoxyribose), and one of four nitrogenous bases—adenine (A), thymine (T), cytosine (C), or guanine (G).</li>
       <li><b class="bold">Base Pairing:</b> Adenine (A) always pairs with thymine (T), forming two hydrogen bonds, while cytosine (C) pairs with guanine (G), forming three hydrogen bonds. This complementary base pairing ensures the stability of the DNA double helix.</li>
       <li><b class="bold">Double Helix Structure:</b> The two DNA strands run in opposite directions (antiparallel) and are connected by hydrogen bonds between the complementary base pairs. The helical structure resembles a twisted ladder, with the sugar-phosphate backbone forming the sides and the base pairs forming the rungs.</li>
       <li><b class="bold">Major and Minor Grooves:</b> The helical structure results in grooves along the DNA molecule. The major groove is larger and more accessible, while the minor groove is narrower. Proteins involved in DNA processes often interact with these grooves.</li>
       <li><b class="bold">DNA Replication:</b> Before cell division, DNA replicates to ensure genetic continuity. The enzyme DNA polymerase adds complementary nucleotides to each original strand, creating two identical DNA molecules.</li>
       <li><b class="bold">Genetic Information:</b> The sequence of nucleotides in DNA encodes genetic information. Genes, specific sequences of DNA, serve as instructions for building and maintaining an organism.</li>

       <li><b class="bold">Complementary Base Pairing:</b> Adenine (A) always pairs with thymine (T), and cytosine (C) always pairs with guanine (G). This specific base pairing ensures the accuracy of DNA replication and maintains the structural integrity of the double helix.</li>
       <li><b class="bold">Twisted Ladder Structure:</b> The overall shape of the DNA molecule resembles a twisted ladder or spiral staircase. The twisting of the helix contributes to the stability of the structure.</li>
       <li><b class="bold">Sugar Phosphate Backbone:</b> The sides of the DNA ladder are composed of alternating sugar (deoxyribose) and phosphate groups. This forms the backbone of the helix and provides structural support.</li>
       <li><b class="bold">Major and Minor Grooves:</b> The helical structure creates grooves along the DNA molecule. The major groove is larger and more accessible, while the minor groove is narrower. These grooves play a role in interactions with proteins involved in DNA processes.</li>

    <div class="content">
    <ol>
      <li><b>Denaturation:</b></li>
      <ul>
        <li><b class="bold">Definition:</b>Denaturation is the process where a double-stranded DNA molecule unwinds and separates into two individual strands.</li>
        <li><b class="bold">Causes:</b>This separation can be induced by various factors such as high temperature, extreme pH, or exposure to certain chemicals. The most common method is by heating.</li>
        <li><b class="bold">Mechanism:</b>High temperature or other denaturing conditions disrupt the hydrogen bonds between complementary base pairs (A-T and G-C), leading to the separation of the two DNA strands.</li>
        <li><b class="bold">Result:</b>The outcome of denaturation is the formation of two single-stranded DNA molecules.</li>
      </ul><br>
      
      <li><b>Renaturation:</b></li>
      <ul>
      <li><b class="bold">Definition:</b>Renaturation is the process in which single-stranded DNA molecules come back together to form a double-stranded structure.</li>
      <li><b class="bold">Conditions:</b>Renaturation is facilitated by cooling the denatured DNA under conditions favoring base pairing. This can involve reducing the temperature or removing denaturing agents.</li>
      <li><b class="bold">Mechanism:</b>As the temperature decreases or denaturing agents are removed, the complementary bases on the single-stranded DNA find their respective partners, and hydrogen bonds reform, leading to the reformation of a double-stranded DNA molecule.</li>
      <li><b class="bold">Significance:</b>Renaturation is crucial in processes like polymerase chain reaction (PCR), where precise temperature control allows selective amplification of specific DNA sequences.</li>
